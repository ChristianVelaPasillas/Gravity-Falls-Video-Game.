# Gravity-Falls-Video-Game.
I created a Videogame from the cartoon series called Gravity Falls, made in Assembly language, in which 10 players can play and there are 10 characters too, the game consists of attacking each other, and each of them has about 5 different attacks, and when the characters have 0 life they die and the character that survives at the end wins.
